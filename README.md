# buyer_rating_system

The current major challenge of ecommerce companies is to protect themselves from fraudulent users.  Some of the buyers order the products and cancel them / Return very frequently. High returns and cancellations cause huge cost to the ecommerce company. 
The goal of this project is to build a backend system which will assign ratings to the buyers based on their behavior patterns, so that the company can take necessary actions to reduce their loss. 

Functionalities:
1. Decrease the rating of the buyers internally based on various parameters/rules like how frequently the buyer has bought, cancelled or returned the orders.
2. Increase the rating of the buyer if he/she is a loyal customer.
3. Based on the above rating, the is intelligent enough to limit functionalities to the buyers like COD, No return policy or blacklist them if they are highly fraudulent.
4. If the rating is high, provide them adhoc coupon codes.
